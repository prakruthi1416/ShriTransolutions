concepts.To adopt the product, we convene the
local standards and marketing collateral to appeal
to the target audience. Our experienced project
managers, advanced translation technology and
comprehensive routines enable us to handle extensive and technically demanding projects. The
combination of technological complexity coupled with linguistic and cultural subtlety is our USP,
which helps many of our clients to globalize their products<br><br>

marketing collateral in various languages, which is the integration of
technology and human creativity; that is often over-looked by design
agencies. We have all the latest industry standard design software and

PageMaker, Photoshop, Illustrator, Corel Draw and Macromedia Freehand.
If your material has already been designed, we can translate, localize and
typeset it for you. Your project can be supplied back to you print ready in its
original format (i.e. Quark), as a PDF/JPEG or as printed material.<br><br>

Every stage of this process is checked in terms of quality with experts in the company. After the
client's approval, the work is executed and completed. The procedure is doubly checked and
supported by backup to avoid accidental data loss. Our panel of translators are skilled in a wide
range of documentation from paper to online information and analysis of the project. The projects
are split based on the client's requirement (Localization and globalization). The projects are
categorized as per the content, purpose and format. We also create glossaries as per the projects'
requirements. Our process includes manual translation with software integration along with
proofreading and editing.<br><br>
